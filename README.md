Benmaxfield.me was created for the primary purpose to display my most recent 
Resume and links to my professional sites (LinkedIn and Github). 

I chose to make the website themed to be something really only a Computer 
Scientist would understand while still looking 'cool' to the outside observer. 
My website works by using a python package called APScheduler to request the 
server to web scrape my Github calendar and my favorite Science News website, 
ScienceDaily.com. I didn't want my website to simply be another 'pretty' 
personal website, but rather show that it's not a static page and to display 
some more uncommon (but still modest) web development knowledge.
